# BUDGET-TRACKER

### USER STORY
``` 
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits 
WITH OR WITHOUT a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 
```

### DEVELOPMENT & TECHNOLOGIES
```
BUDGET-TRACKER RENDERS a UI via HTML/CSS, with JavaScript for its 
front-end functionality (transaction buttons, graph renderings, etc.). 
INDEXEDDB IS USED to create a virtual object store, 
in which data can be stored and accessed while "offline". 
A SERVICE-WORKER is also needed to cache all requisite directory files when offline. 
TOGETHER, INDEXEDDB and service-worker.js provide sufficient functionality for 
Budget-Tracker users regardless of network access.
